## Knapsack Problem – Dynamic Programming (C)

This project implements the 0/1 Knapsack problem using Dynamic Programming in C.
It takes real-time user input for weights, values, and knapsack capacity, and
computes the maximum achievable profit using a tabulation-based DP approach.

### Concepts Used
- Dynamic Programming
- Time and Space Complexity
- Arrays and Iterative Logic

### How to Run
gcc pbl.c
./a.out
